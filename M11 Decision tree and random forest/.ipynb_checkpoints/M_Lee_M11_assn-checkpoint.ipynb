    "Problem Summary:\n",
    "The assignment involves developing and comparing two types of machine learning models – a Decision Tree and a Random Forest – to predict the level of Regents diploma awards among various student subgroups in New York State school districts. The dataset provides a detailed view of graduation statistics, segmented by different categorizations and subgroupings, across NY State school districts for the 2018-2019 school year. The primary goal is to predict a new categorical variable that classifies the percentage of Regents diplomas awarded into three categories: low, medium, and high, based on the relationship with the median percentage of all Regents diplomas awarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Address the Problem:\n",
    "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
    "* Assess the dataset's overall structure, quality, and distribution.\n",
    "* Identify any anomalies, missing values, or inconsistencies in the data.\n",
    "* Perform statistical summaries and visualizations to understand the data's characteristics and underlying patterns.\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "* Clean the data by handling missing values and incorrect data types, especially for numerical columns stored as objects.\n",
    "* Create the target variable by categorizing the reg_pct attribute into three classes (low, medium, high) based on the specified criteria.\n",
    "* Encode categorical variables and normalize/standardize numerical variables as necessary.\n",
    "3. **Prepped Data Review**:\n",
    "* Conduct a second round of EDA on the prepared dataset.\n",
    "* Verify the integrity of the data post-preparation and ensure it's suitable for modeling.\n",
    "4. **Decision Tree and Random Forest Modeling**:\n",
    "* Develop a Decision Tree model and a Random Forest model using the prepared dataset.\n",
    "* Select relevant features and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.\n",
    "* Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics to assess their prediction accuracy and generalization capability.\n",
    "5. **Model Selection and Evaluation**:\n",
    "* Compare the performance of the Decision Tree and Random Forest models.\n",
    "* Select the preferred model based on a balance of accuracy, interpretability, and complexity.\n",
    "* Apply the chosen model to a testing subset to evaluate its real-world applicability and performance.\n",
    "6. **Conclusions**:\n",
    "* Summarize the findings from the model comparisons.\n",
    "* Discuss the implications of the model's performance and potential areas for further research or improvement."
